# django_csvfixtures

Django 5 library to import CSV files as fixtures from the `/admin` panel or directly from each model list page.
Designed to be **plug-and-play**, **installable via pip**, and ready for publication on **GitHub / PyPI**.


## ‚úÖ Summary

This app (`csvfixture_importer`) provides:

* Automatic detection of all models in the project (`django.apps.apps.get_models()`).
* Central admin panel at `/admin/csv-fixtures/` with a model selector and CSV upload input.
* `CSVFixtureModelAdminMixin` to add an **‚ÄúUpload fixture‚Äù** button in each model changelist view.
* CSV importer that creates objects (header = model field name).
* Support for basic field types (`CharField`, `IntegerField`, `BooleanField`, `DateField`, `DecimalField`, etc.) and `ForeignKey` (by PK).
* Upload summary with created objects, error count, and total rows.


## üîß Installation (via pip / PyPI)

Once published to PyPI or installed from GitHub:

```bash
pip install django-csvfixtures
```

Add it to your `settings.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'csvfixture_importer',
]
```

Then open `/admin/csv-fixtures/` or use the ‚ÄúUpload fixture‚Äù button from any model.

## üìù Example CSV Upload

Here is an example of how to create 2 objects for two models: `Zone` and `Section`.

### CSV for `Zone`:

```csv
id,name,number
1,North Zone,101
2,South Zone,102
```

### CSV for `Section`:

```csv
id,name,number,zone_id
1,Section A,1,1
2,Section B,2,2
```

**Notes:**

* Upload `Zone.csv` first, then `Section.csv` (so the foreign key exists).
* The `zone_id` field in `Section` corresponds to the `id` of the `Zone` objects.
* Fields in the CSV must exactly match the model field names.

This example can be used directly in the admin panel or via the **Upload fixture** button in each model‚Äôs changelist.

This keeps the library fully **plug-and-play**, **admin-integrated**, and **ready for production use** without requiring the user to manually include any URLs or modify their Django configuration.
